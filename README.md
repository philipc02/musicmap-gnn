# musicmap-gnn
This project explores graph neural networks (GNNs) for music classification on the FMA dataset. The idea is to represent tracks as nodes in a graph and learn relationships between them using audio-based features. Setting up feature extraction and graph construction, training model to classify genre of song/node correctly and creating evaluation scripts.
